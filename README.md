# Flash Card App for Learning French  
This is a flash card application built using Python and Tkinter, designed to help users learn French words. The app displays a French word for a few seconds, then flips the card to show the English translation. Users can mark words they already know, and the app will remove those words from future practice sessions.  
  
## Features:  
**Flash Card Interface:** Displays French words with their English translations after a timed delay.  
**Learning Progress:** Users can mark words as known, and the app will save the remaining words to a CSV file for future sessions.  
**Data Persistence:** Uses pandas to handle word data and save progress, ensuring that the learning session continues where the user left off.  
**Dynamic Word Selection:** Words are selected randomly from a list of French-English word pairs, ensuring varied learning.
